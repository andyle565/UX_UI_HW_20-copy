    <h2> Project Summary:</h2>
    <p>SARA Sanctuary stands for Society For Animal Rescue
        and Adoption. The non-profit cares and feeds over
        600 animals. The website has over 6,000 visitors a 
        month and many of the users do not feel comfortable
        making a donation on the website. </p>
    <h2>Goal:</h2>
    <p>Redesign the website for the users to feel trustworthy 
        to make a donation to the non-profit. </p>

    <h2>Problem statement</h2>
    <p>SARA Sanctuary website was designed to allow visitors to build trust with the 
        organization and donate to the cause. We have observed that SARA’s website
        donation  process does not flow smoothly and does not build trust with the 
        visitors, which is causing many visitors to leave the site and not donate to the
        non-profit. How might we improve SARA’s website so that we can increase the
        number of donations?</p>

                <h3>Proto Persona</h3>
                <p>I created a Photo Persona, who will
                    resemble someone that would visit
                    SARA’s website. Proto Persona is a
                    great way to start the project to

                <p>After interviewing with the stakeholders,
                    there are over 6000+ visitors a month, 
                    some visitors were determined to 
                    donate that they email because the
                    process was complicated.
                    Stakeholders want to tone to remain 
                    positive and impactful.
                    Their main priorities are donations,
                    volunteers, and adoption. </p>

                    Facebook and received a total of 17
                    responses. The survey’s intention is to 
                    determine if the participants supported
                    any non-profit organization, why they 
                    supported the organizations, and find

                they have difficultly navigating through the site. </p>

                brainstorming session with the team.
                Affinity Diagram is a useful process to 
                sort and identify the insights in data.

                clear” and “I want the navigation to be
                simple to use” in order to have a better

            <p> I created a User Persona for the team,
                which is based on all of the research 
                we have done. The purpose of a User
                Persona is to create realistic 
                representations of our key users. Our 
                User Persona, Emily, has been 
                volunteering and participating in many
                local philanthropy events and her main
                goal os to make a donation to an 
                animal shelter.  </p>

      <div class="User Insight">
        <h2>User Insight</h2>
        <p>I constructed an User Insight to help clarify and develop a deep understanding of 
            a User Persona by telling their story. User insights is useful to uncover underlying
            motivations, analyst unmet needs, validate ideas and help come up with a 
            solution for the problems later in the process.
            
            Emily Patterson, who is an animal advocate, wants to donate to SARA’s 
            Sanctuary because she wants to support her local community and values the life
            of every animal.
            
            During our interviews, we discovered that the majority of interviewees felt 
            uninformed and insecure about the donation process.
            
            Therefore, we believe that by creating a more clear, trustworthy donation page 
            and web-pretense might increase the amount of donations and user return to 
            the website.
            
            We might do this by redesigning the information artitecture, the visual hierarchy,
            the navigation system, and making the donation information more clear to our
            visitors. Doing this will allow our website to be trustworthy to donate and increase
            traffic of visitors. </p>

            <h3>User Journey Map</h3>
            <p> The team created a User Journey Map
                to show a visual representation of the
                experience of the user. Specifically, it is
                helpful to identify where in the 
                process the users are experiencing the
                pain points. The opportunities section
                will show how to resolve the pain points.
                
                According to our User Journey Map,
                Emily does not exactly understand what
                SARA’s Sanctuary is all about, therefore
                including a mission statement on the 
                homepage will help Emily have a better
                understanding of the purpose of SARA’s
                Sanctuary. Simplifying the options of 
                donations will be intended to reduce the
                amount of cognitive overload Emily will
                experience when donating.

                interact with the website. The “happy
                path” is for our Users to make a monthly
                donation, since the stakeholder stated
                in the interviews that they heavily rely
                on monthly donations to determine the 
                amount of charities they will receive for
                the sanctuary.

useful during the redesign of a website naviation, where designers will collaborate

We worked on recategorizing the navigation to build trust into the site. The new
navigation will consist of About, Donate, Volunteer, Adoption, and Contact Us

<section class="Conclusion">
    <h1 class="text-center h1 mb-2 bg-dark text-white">Conclusion</h1>
    <p1>Our solution tested successful, were our users stated they felt comfortable of
        making a donation and the process felt smooth to them. When users do not have 
        to think hard to navigate through a site, it is most likely a win for the designers.
        
        Looking back after the project, I believe our group could have used the “I like, I
        Wish, and What If Method during our brainstorming of UI ideas. There were many
        times through the design phase where we would speak out on the ideas that we 
        liked. If we would have used that method, then our design process would have 
        been more effect and get the right designs down.
        
        The next step is to create animations on the web page for the users to have more
        interactions with the site. We are still in contact with the stakeholders and are in 
        talks to implement the designs into their site.</p1>
